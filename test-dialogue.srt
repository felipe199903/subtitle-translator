00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,200
Good morning! How did you sleep?

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,300
I slept well, thank you for asking.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,500
Would you like some coffee or tea?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,800
Coffee sounds great, but make it strong.

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,600
I have an important meeting at 9 AM today.

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,400
Don't worry, everything will go smoothly.

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,200
The presentation looks fantastic, by the way.

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,900
Thanks! I worked on it until midnight yesterday.

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,700
Your dedication is truly admirable.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,500
Success requires sacrifice and persistence.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,300
That's exactly what my mentor used to say.

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,600
Wise words indeed. Now, shall we go?

13
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,800
Yes, let's not keep them waiting.

14
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,900
See you later, and good luck!

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,500
Thank you so much!
